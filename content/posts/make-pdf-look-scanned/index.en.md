You have a perfect digital PDF, but you need it to look like it was scanned. Maybe an institution requires a "scanned copy," or you want your document to have that authentic, physical-document feel. Whatever the reason, making a PDF look scanned is easier than you think — and you don't need Photoshop or any complex software.

In this guide, we'll show you exactly how to add realistic scan effects to any PDF, completely free.

## 🤔 Why Would You Need a PDF to Look Scanned?

There are many legitimate reasons to make a PDF look scanned:

- **Institutional requirements** — Many organizations still ask for "scanned copies" of documents, even when you only have digital versions
- **Consistency** — When submitting multiple documents, having them all look scanned creates a uniform appearance
- **Authenticity** — A scanned look can make digital documents feel more official or "real"
- **Archiving** — Creating scan-style archives for record-keeping purposes
- **Privacy** — Making documents look scanned can hide the fact that they were created digitally

## 🛠️ Methods to Make a PDF Look Scanned

### Method 1: Print and Re-scan (Not Recommended)

The old-school approach: print your PDF, then scan it back.

**Why this is inefficient:**
- Wastes paper and ink
- Requires a physical scanner
- Takes time and effort
- Quality degradation is unpredictable
- Not environmentally friendly

### Method 2: Image Editing Software

Use Photoshop, GIMP, or similar tools to manually add effects.

**Drawbacks:**
- Steep learning curve
- Time-consuming for multiple pages
- Expensive (for Photoshop)
- Results vary based on skill level

### Method 3: Online Scan Effect Tools (Recommended)

Use a dedicated tool designed specifically for this purpose. This is the fastest, easiest, and most consistent method.

## 📝 Step-by-Step: Make Your PDF Look Scanned

Follow these simple steps to transform your PDF:

### Step 1: Open Look Scanned

Go to [lookscanned.io](https://lookscanned.io) in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Step 2: Upload Your PDF

Drag and drop your file, or click to browse. Your file stays on your device — nothing is uploaded to any server.

### Step 3: Customize the Scan Effect

Adjust the settings to achieve your desired look:

- **Add slight rotation** — A 1-2 degree tilt makes it look like the paper wasn't perfectly aligned
- **Increase noise** — Adds the grainy texture typical of scanned documents
- **Adjust brightness/contrast** — Scanned documents often have slightly different exposure
- **Choose color mode** — Grayscale is classic for scanned documents, but you can keep color or use sepia for an aged look

### Step 4: Download Your Scanned PDF

Click the download button. Your PDF now looks like it was scanned on a real scanner.

That's it — four simple steps, no software installation, no account creation, no file uploads.

## 🎯 Tips for Realistic Results

Want your PDF to look convincingly scanned? Here are some pro tips:

1. **Don't overdo the rotation** — Real scans are usually only slightly tilted (0.5-2 degrees)
2. **Use moderate noise** — Too much looks artificial, too little looks digital
3. **Consider grayscale** — Most official scanned documents are black and white
4. **Add slight blur** — Real scanners don't produce perfectly sharp images
5. **Vary settings for multi-page documents** — Real scans have slight variations between pages
