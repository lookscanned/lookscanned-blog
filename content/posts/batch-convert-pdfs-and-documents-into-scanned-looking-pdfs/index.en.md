   - Rotate + variance: small angles mimic natural scanner skew

## Quality presets and tips

- Text‑heavy documents
  - Grayscale, low blur, moderate contrast, minimal noise
- Forms and contracts
  - Slight rotation variance, subtle border, low noise for authenticity
- Creative or archival aesthetics
  - A touch more noise and a light yellowish tint
- Keep it realistic
  - Avoid extreme blur or heavy noise that hurts readability

## Performance tips for large batches

- Prefer a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) for fastest processing
- Avoid running many heavy tabs/apps concurrently during conversion
- Very large images: consider compressing or reducing resolution beforehand
- If you have hundreds of pages/files, process in smaller batches for smoother UX

## Troubleshooting

  - If an Office file fails to import, export it to PDF first, then convert
- Missing fonts from DOCX/PPTX
  - Embed fonts or export to PDF to preserve appearance
- Output too large
  - Lower resolution slightly and reduce noise/contrast
- Output too soft
  - Reduce blur and increase resolution modestly
