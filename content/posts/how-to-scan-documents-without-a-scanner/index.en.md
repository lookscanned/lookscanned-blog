You need to submit a scanned copy of a document, but you don't have a scanner. Sound familiar? Whether it's a signed contract, an application form, or expense receipts, many institutions still require "scanned" documents. But buying a physical scanner just for occasional use seems wasteful, and running to a print shop is inconvenient.

The good news? You can scan documents without a scanner—and it's easier than you think.

## 🔍 Common Methods to Scan Without a Scanner

### 1. Mobile Scanning Apps

Apps like CamScanner, Adobe Scan, or Microsoft Lens let you take photos of documents and convert them into PDFs.

**Pros:**
- Convenient if you have a printed document
- Auto-edge detection and perspective correction

**Cons:**
- You need a **physical paper copy** first—if your document is already digital (PDF, Word, image), you'd have to print it, then photograph it
- Quality depends on lighting and camera steadiness
- Most apps **upload your files to cloud servers**, raising privacy concerns
- Often require account registration

### 2. Print Shop / Office Services

Visit a local print shop or office center to use their scanner.

**Pros:**
- Professional equipment, high quality

**Cons:**
- Inconvenient—requires travel and waiting
- Costs money
- **Privacy risk**—strangers handle your sensitive documents
- Not available 24/7

### 3. All-in-One Printers

Many home printers include scanning functionality.

**Pros:**
- No additional cost if you already own one

**Cons:**
- Most people don't have one
- Requires physical paper to scan
- Bulky and needs maintenance

## 💡 The Smarter Solution: Convert Digital Files Directly

Here's the thing most people overlook: **if your document is already digital, you don't need to print and scan it.**

Think about it—your contract is a PDF, your form is a Word document, your ID is an image file. Why go through the hassle of:

1. Printing the document
2. Signing it by hand (if needed)
3. Taking a photo or scanning it
4. Hoping the quality is acceptable

Instead, you can **add realistic scanning effects directly to your digital files**. The result looks exactly like a scanned document—complete with subtle rotation, noise, and paper texture—without ever touching a physical scanner.

This is exactly what [Look Scanned](https://lookscanned.io) does.
