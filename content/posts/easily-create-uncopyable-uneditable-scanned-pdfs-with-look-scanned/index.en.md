In the digital world, protecting sensitive documents is crucial. Whether you're sharing contracts, reports, or confidential information, you may want to prevent others from copying or modifying the content. One effective way to achieve this is by converting your PDF into a **scanned-like document**, making it appear as a physical scan rather than an editable file.

With **Look Scanned**, you can effortlessly turn any PDF into a **non-copyable, non-editable scanned version**—all within your browser. No installations, no uploads, and no privacy concerns.

## Why Make PDFs Uncopyable and Uneditable?

By default, PDFs allow text selection, copying, and even direct modifications with certain software. However, converting them into **scanned-style documents** offers several benefits:

- **Prevents Text Copying** – The content appears as an image rather than selectable text.
- **Blocks Editing** – The document behaves like a physical scan, making modifications difficult.
- **Ensures Authenticity** – It looks like a genuine scanned copy, which can be useful for official or archival purposes.
- **Enhances Privacy** – Since the process is done locally in your browser, no data is sent to external servers.
