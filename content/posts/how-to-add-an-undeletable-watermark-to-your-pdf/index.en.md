Watermarks are a common way to protect documents, but traditional watermarks can often be removed or bypassed with just a few clicks. In this post, weâ€™ll show you how to create a **truly undeletable watermark** using **Look Scanned**, a browser-based tool that simulates scanned documents for enhanced document security.

## Why Traditional Watermarks Can Be Removed Easily

Most PDF editors treat watermarks as separate layers or text elements. That means:

- Users can **select and delete** watermarks using tools like Adobe Acrobat or Foxit;
- Watermarks are often **not embedded into the actual content** of the page;
- OCR (optical character recognition) software can read the content **beneath or around** the watermark, essentially ignoring it.

## The Look Scanned Approach: Burnt-In, Uneditable Watermarks

Look Scanned takes a different approach by converting the entire page into a **scanned-like image**, where all visible contentâ€”including the watermarkâ€”is baked into the visual appearance of the page.

Here's why this method works:

- **Watermarks become part of the image itself**, not a separate element;
- The resulting PDF is **non-editable** and **non-selectable**â€”ideal for preventing content theft;
- **OCR extraction is difficult**, making it harder to bypass the watermark even with advanced tools;
- Even powerful PDF editors **can't remove** the watermark, because it no longer exists as a separate layer.

## How to Add an Undeletable Watermark with Look Scanned

1. Visit [Look Scanned](https://lookscanned.io) and upload your original PDF;
2. Go to **Advanced Settings** and enable the **Watermark** option;
3. Customize your watermark text (e.g., company name, email address, "CONFIDENTIAL", etc.);
4. Adjust the style: font, size, opacity, angle, and repetition pattern;
5. Apply the scan effect and export your watermarked PDF.

The final result:

- A realistic scanned PDF that **looks like a physical copy**;
- A watermark that is **visually embedded** and **cannot be removed or edited**;
- A secure document that is **hard to copy, modify, or tamper with**.

## Perfect for These Use Cases

- Internal documents (e.g., "For Internal Use Only")
- Document drafts (e.g., "DRAFT" watermark)
- Training materials and textbooks
- Shared documents under NDA or review
